**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client, The Gaming Room is an established mobile app game creator known for launching the game Draw It or Lose It on the Android platform. Their primary objective was to extend the reach of their game by expanding to other platforms. They aimed to create a web-based version of their existing mobile app, enabling access across various devices and platforms. The key priorities of the project were to enhance the functionality of the software and broaden its availability. The application should be distributable to both iOS and Android. Staying within budget and on timeline are high priorities. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I believe I did a good job articulating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed solutions. I attempted to create a comprehensive recommendation section, ensuring coverage of critical aspects for client consideration, like the host operating system, security measures, the advantages of cloud-based architecture, API frameworks, along with, memory and storage management solutions. I tried to provide strong arguments for the applicability of cloud-based architecture, aligning it to the client's goals.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Analyzing the UML class diagram was useful in understanding the relationship between various entities representative of the application's inner workings. Breaking down the project into smaller parts and creating a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach was helpful. It was integral in creating a solid plan that best aligned with the client's requirements.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I did not keep track of all my resources for the document. If I could go back, I would make a list of every article I utilized to reinforce that I have the most well-informed opinion. I missed some ideas when it came to evaluating each of the platforms. I did not address the web browsers that are suitable for the different operating systems, and this is important to the success of the program as the client is looking to deploy a web-based program on multiple operating systems. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The most important consideration should be the needs of the user. If a user's needs are not met, they will not continue to use your program. It also creates an opening for a competitor to poach your user base by catering to their needs. Continually maintaining a satisfied user base is key to creating loyalty and user interest. I made sure to consider the overall user experience while playing the game and chose to design my approach in a manner that best aligned with this.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I approached the design of the software by starting with a broader point. I tried to list out the general direction I wanted to take my approach before working out the finer details. Keeping track of the most important objectives and working through each approach helped me come to a conclusion. This can be accomplished by taking the client's objectives and turning them into functional requirements, considering the key functionality required to meet the objective. From there, you break down the functional requirements to devise a technical approach. Keeping track of these through a design document, architectural diagrams, and code to meet these requirements.
